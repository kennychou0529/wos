## Toolchain
I generally followed the instructions [here](https://cs.au.dk/~sortie/dopsys/osdev). I first started with the build chain the same as the page but ran into some compiling problems and decided to use current releases of the toolchain. What I used is:
  - binutils-2.27
  - gcc-6.3.0
  - gmp-6.1.2
  - mpc-1.0.3
  - mpfr-3.1.5
